### To-Do List API
**Purpose:** Manage a simple to-do list with API endpoints.

**Routes:**
- `POST /tasks` - Add a task
- `GET /tasks` - Retrieve all tasks
- `PUT /tasks/:id` - Update a task (mark as complete, etc.)
- `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete a specific task

**Practice:** Full CRUD operations, route params, working with JSON data
