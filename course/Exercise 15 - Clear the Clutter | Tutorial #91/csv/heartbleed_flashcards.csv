Front,Back
What is Heartbleed?,"A major security vulnerability in the OpenSSL library that allowed attackers to read memory from servers, potentially exposing sensitive data."
When was Heartbleed publicly disclosed?,"April 7, 2014."
Which versions of OpenSSL were affected by Heartbleed?,Versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f.
Was the TLS protocol itself flawed in the Heartbleed vulnerability?,"No, the flaw was in the implementation of TLS in OpenSSL, not the protocol itself."
What mechanism in TLS is related to Heartbleed?,"The Heartbeat mechanism, which tests if a secure communication link is still active."
How did the Heartbleed bug work?,"OpenSSL did not validate the payload length in Heartbeat requests, allowing attackers to read extra memory."
What kind of malformed request was used to exploit Heartbleed?,"A small payload with a large length field, causing the server to return extra data from memory."
Could attackers control what memory was returned via Heartbleed?,"No, they could control the amount of memory but not the specific memory content."
What types of data could be leaked due to Heartbleed?,"Private keys, session cookies, user credentials, and other sensitive information."
What is the major consequence of Heartbleed?,It undermined internet confidentiality by exposing unencrypted memory contents from secure servers.
