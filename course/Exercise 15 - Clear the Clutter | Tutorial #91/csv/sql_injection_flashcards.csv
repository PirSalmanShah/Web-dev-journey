What is SQL Injection (SQLi)?,A web application attack where a hacker inserts malicious SQL commands into input fields to gain unauthorized access or control over the database.
What are the main purposes of SQL Injection?,"Bypass login, access/modify/delete data, drop tables, and execute admin operations."
How does SQL Injection work?,It exploits the lack of input validation by injecting SQL commands into query strings.
Why is SQL Injection similar to buffer overflow?,Both involve injecting input that alters the intended execution logic.
What is input sanitization?,Modifying or processing input to ensure it is safe before use in a query.
What is blacklisting in input sanitization?,"Removing known dangerous characters like ', ;, -- from input."
What is escaping in input sanitization?,"Replacing harmful characters with safe ones, e.g., ' to ', ; to \;, etc."
What is whitelisting in input validation?,"Accepting only inputs that meet safe, predefined criteria."
What is a prepared statement?,"A method to separate code from data, treating user input by type to prevent SQLi."
How does limiting user privileges help database security?,"Reduces what commands and tables a user can access, limiting damage if hacked."
Why encrypt sensitive data in databases?,"To protect data like passwords, making it useless if stolen."
What is SQLMap?,An open-source tool for detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
What does SQLMap automate?,"Detection, exploitation, and database management in penetration testing."
What is Boolean-Based Blind Injection?,A technique using true/false queries to infer database info via HTTP response differences.
What is Time-Based Blind Injection?,"Uses SQL commands like SLEEP to delay response, inferring data without visible output."
What is Error-Based Injection?,"Forces database errors that leak data, effective if errors are visible to users."
What is UNION Query-Based Injection?,Uses the UNION operator to combine and display query results directly.
What are Stacked Queries?,"Executes multiple queries in one call (e.g., with a semicolon), allowing deeper exploits."
What DBMSs does SQLMap support?,"MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, and more."
What input methods does SQLMap accept?,"URL, Burp Suite logs, Google dorks, GET/POST/Cookie/Header parameters."
What fingerprinting features does SQLMap offer?,"Identifies DBMS type, version, OS, users, privileges, tables, and columns."
What exploitation capabilities does SQLMap have?,"Runs OS commands, uploads/downloads files, and provides interactive shell access."
